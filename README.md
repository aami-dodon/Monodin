# Monodin
Monodin is a local-first journaling app that transforms handwritten journal entries into meaningful insights. Users upload images of their journals, and the system extracts sentiment, emotions, tasks, and goals, then visualizes them in a dashboard.

All processing runs locally â€” no cloud, no data sharing.
